    collection of nodes and edges
    
- Subtree

- No of edges = ?
    
    No of nodes - 1
    
- Root
    
    First node on the top
    
- Parent
    
    A node is a parent to its very next descendants
    
- Child
- Sibling
    
    Children of same parent
    
- Descendents
    
    Set of all those nodes which can be reached from a particular node
    
- Ancestors
    
    For any node, all the nodes along the path from that node to root node.
    
- Degree of a node
    
    no of children it is having
    
- Internal nodes / Non-leaf nodes / Non-terminal nodes
    
    nodes with degrees > 0
    
- External nodes / Leaf nodes / Terminal nodes
    
    nodes with degree 0
    
- Levels
- Height
- Forest
